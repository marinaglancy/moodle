This files describes API changes in tagging, information provided
here is intended especially for developers.

=== 3.0 ===

* Tagging courses is now implemented without user id - through course edit form or
  special "Course tags" form. All coursetag_* functions in /tag/coursetagslib.php
  were deprecated without replacement and related JS code was removed. Config variable
  $CFG->block_tags_showcoursetags was removed.
* Each plugin must define the tag areas it uses in plugindir/db/tag.php
  See https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Tag_API for more details.
* When adding a 'tags' form element the component and itemtype must be specified
  in the element attributes.
* Tag name is no longer a unique field in 'tag' table, tags may be separated in
  tag collections
* Specifying component is also required when retrieving item tags. This will allow
  different components to add tags to the same table (for example blog and forum
  posts) and even suggest alternative tagging for the same items.
* The following functions were deprecated because they now require either tag
  collection id or component:
  - tag_get_tags
  - tag_get_tags_array
  - tag_get_tags_csv
  - tag_get_tags_ids
  - tag_get_id
  - tag_rename
  - tag_delete_instance
  - tag_find_records
  - tag_add
  - tag_assign
  - tag_record_count
  - tag_record_tagged_with
* The following tag functions were deprecated:
  - tag_type_set
  - tag_description_set
  - tag_set_flag
  - tag_unset_flag

=== 2.7 ===

* The functions tag_set, tag_set_add, tag_set_delete and tag_assign now expect the component
and contextid of the item being tagged.
