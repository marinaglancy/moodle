Feature: We can understand the gradebook user report
  In order to understand the gradebook user report
  As an teacher
  I need to see the calculated weights for each type of aggregation

  Background:
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category | groupmode |
      | Course 1 | C1 | 0 | 1 |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email | idnumber |
      | teacher1 | Teacher | 1 | teacher1@asd.com | t1 |
      | student1 | Student | 1 | student1@asd.com | s1 |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user | course | role |
      | teacher1 | C1 | editingteacher |
      | student1 | C1 | student |
    And the following "activities" exist:
      | activity | course | idnumber | name | intro |
      | assign | C1 | a1 | Test assignment one | Submit something! |
      | assign | C1 | a2 | Test assignment two | Submit something! |
      | assign | C1 | a3 | Test assignment three | Submit something! |
      | assign | C1 | a4 | Test assignment four | Submit something! |
      | assign | C1 | a5 | Test assignment five | Submit something! |
      | assign | C1 | a6 | Test assignment six | Submit something! |
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I set the following administration settings values:
      | grade_aggregations_visible | Mean of grades,Weighted mean of grades,Simple weighted mean of grades,Mean of grades (with extra credits),Median of grades,Lowest grade,Highest grade,Mode of grades,Natural |
